Schuster is a multinational retail company dealing in sports goods and accessories. Schuster conducts significant business with hundreds of its vendors, with whom it has credit arrangements. Schuster would try to understand its customers’ payment behaviour and predict the likelihood of late payments against open invoices.
# Goal 
Schuster would like to better understand the customers’ payment behaviour based on their past payment patterns (customer segmentation).
Using historical information, it wants to be able to predict the likelihood of delayed payment against open invoices from its customers.
It wants to use this information so that collectors can prioritise their work in following up with customers beforehand to get the payments on time.

To summarise, as a business analyst, you want to find the answer to these questions:

How can we analyse the customer transactions data to find different payment behaviours?
In which way can you segregate the customers based on their previous payment patterns/behaviours?
Based on the historical data, can you predict the likelihood of delayed payment against open invoices from the customers?
Can you draw any business insights based on your developed model?
